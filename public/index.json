It\u0026rsquo;s a strategic choice.\nThe Validation Test If\u0026hellip; Then\u0026hellip; A3R provides value without AI We have a core product A3R needs AI to work We have a wrapper By launching \u0026ldquo;naked\u0026rdquo; first, we force ourselves to prove the value of Automated Artifact Analysis (A3R) using pure logic:\nRegex patterns that catch obfuscated PowerShell Heuristic scoring that weights threat indicators Deterministic rules that produce the same output for the same input Same input → Same output. Every time. Auditable. Defensible in court.\nWhy This Matters for Your SOC 1. No Hallucination Risk LLMs can fabricate MITRE techniques, invent IOCs, or confidently misclassify benign activity as malicious. Our deterministic engine doesn\u0026rsquo;t guess — it matches patterns and applies weighted logic.\n2. Reproducible Verdicts When your analyst runs the same alert through AegisPrime twice, they get the exact same verdict. No variability, no \u0026ldquo;well, it depends on how the model feels today.\u0026rdquo;\n3. Faster Response No API calls to OpenAI. No waiting for GPU inference. Pure Python logic executes in milliseconds.\nBeta 2: AI as Force Multiplier When we add LLM capabilities in Beta 2, the AI won\u0026rsquo;t be the brain — it will be the explainer.\nThe verdict will already exist. The AI\u0026rsquo;s job is to articulate why the deterministic logic flagged the artifact, making the reasoning accessible to junior analysts.\nPhase Role Beta 1 (Now) Engine proves value without AI Beta 2 (Future) AI explains the engine\u0026rsquo;s decisions The AI becomes a force multiplier, not the foundation.\nThe Sovereign AI Difference When Phase 2 ships, we still won\u0026rsquo;t rent intelligence from OpenAI, Anthropic, or any third-party provider.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t rent intelligence from OpenAI.

When the GPU finishes processing, that memory is wiped. No logs. No training. No egress.\nWhat This Means for You If you\u0026rsquo;re evaluating security tools that claim to be \u0026ldquo;AI-powered,\u0026rdquo; ask them:\nWhat happens when the AI is unavailable? Can I reproduce a verdict from last week? Who owns the AI infrastructure?

A3R (Automated Artifact Analysis \u0026amp; Response) is a new security discipline that sits between EDR and SOAR. While EDR detects threats and SOAR manages tickets, A3R autonomously deconstructs forensic evidence, verifies the threat with deterministic logic, and generates the final incident report.\nA3R addresses the critical gap in modern security operations: the analyst bottleneck between detection and response.\nWhere A3R Fits in the Security Stack ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ DETECTION LAYER │ │ EDR / XDR / SIEM / Email Gateway │ │ \u0026#34;Something happened\u0026#34; │ └─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘ │ ▼ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ A3R LAYER │ │ Automated Artifact Analysis \u0026amp; Response │ │ \u0026#34;Here\u0026#39;s exactly what happened and what to do\u0026#34; │ └─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘ │ ▼ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ ORCHESTRATION LAYER │ │ SOAR / Ticketing │ │ \u0026#34;Execute the response\u0026#34; │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ The Gap A3R Closes Layer What It Does What It Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Do EDR/XDR Detects suspicious activity, collects telemetry Doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain why it\u0026rsquo;s bad or what to do A3R Deconstructs artifacts, verifies threats, generates reports Doesn\u0026rsquo;t detect or execute response actions SOAR Orchestrates playbooks, automates response actions Doesn\u0026rsquo;t analyze evidence or make risk decisions How A3R Works A3R processes security alerts through a deterministic analysis pipeline that extracts, evaluates, and verifies every artifact in the alert data.\nThe A3R Pipeline Artifact Extraction — Parse URLs, IPs, domains, processes, files, and command-line arguments from alert data Heuristic Analysis — Apply behavioral detection rules to identify suspicious patterns MITRE Correlation — Map detected behaviors to ATT\u0026amp;CK techniques and tactics Risk Scoring — Calculate weighted risk scores based on artifact behavior Threat Intelligence Enrichment — Query external TI sources to validate indicators Report Generation — Produce structured incident reports with Root Cause Analysis Deterministic, Not Probabilistic Unlike machine learning-based tools that produce confidence intervals and \u0026ldquo;best guesses,\u0026rdquo; A3R is fully deterministic:\nSame input → Same output. Every time. No hallucinations.\nThis means:\nAuditable decisions — Every verdict traces back to specific rules and patterns No model drift — Behavior doesn\u0026rsquo;t change unexpectedly over time Explainable results — Analysts understand exactly why an alert was flagged The Three Pillars of A3R 1. Automated Artifact Deconstruction A3R extracts and categorizes every forensic artifact from alert data:\nArtifact Type What A3R Extracts Processes Execution paths, command-line args, parent/child relationships Network URLs, domains, IP addresses, ports, connection patterns Files File paths, hashes, extensions, write locations Behaviors LOLBin usage, encoded commands, persistence mechanisms 2. Deterministic Threat Verification Each artifact is evaluated against layered detection logic:\nDetection Layer Example Patterns Known Malicious Known malware families, attack frameworks LOLBin Abuse Living-off-the-land binary misuse Behavioral Flags Suspicious execution patterns, lateral movement Network Indicators Untrusted infrastructure, domain spoofing 3. Autonomous Report Generation A3R produces complete incident reports ready for customer delivery:\nHeadline — What type of attack was detected Narrative — Plain-English explanation of the attack sequence Entry Point — How the attack began Artifacts — Every indicator with verdict and reasoning MITRE Mapping — Attack chain aligned to ATT\u0026amp;CK framework Mitigation Steps — Specific, actionable remediation recommendations The \u0026ldquo;Zero-Context\u0026rdquo; Advantage Most EDRs are behavioral—they need to observe a process doing something malicious to catch it. If they miss the execution, they miss the threat.\nA3R is intrinsic—it analyzes the artifact itself.\nApproach What It Does The Limitation EDR (Behavioral) \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t see who ran this command, so I can\u0026rsquo;t say if it\u0026rsquo;s bad.\u0026rdquo; Requires execution context A3R (Intrinsic) \u0026ldquo;This syntax is a known attack pattern. It is malicious by definition, regardless of who ran it.\u0026rdquo; None—artifact speaks for itself This allows A3R to catch Living-off-the-Land (LOLBin) attacks that often slip past behavioral monitors. When an attacker uses legitimate system tools in malicious ways, A3R recognizes the pattern—not the permission.\nWhy A3R Matters The Analyst Bottleneck Security teams drown in alerts. The typical workflow:\nEDR fires alert → goes to queue Analyst manually investigates (10-30 minutes) Analyst writes incident report (15-45 minutes) Ticket created in SOAR → response executed The problem: Steps 2 and 3 require skilled analysts and significant time. This creates a bottleneck that limits how many alerts can be properly investigated.\nA3R Eliminates the Bottleneck With A3R:\nEDR fires alert → A3R processes automatically A3R deconstructs artifacts + generates report (~seconds) Analyst reviews and validates (2-5 minutes) Ticket created in SOAR → response executed Result: Dramatic reduction in time-to-report. Analysts focus on validation and response, not manual investigation.\nA3R vs. Traditional Approaches Capability Manual Analysis SOAR Playbooks A3R Artifact extraction Human reading logs Static parsers Dynamic, context-aware extraction Threat verification Analyst judgment Rule-based (yes/no) Weighted scoring + reasoning Report generation Human writing Templates Autonomous narrative generation Scalability Limited by headcount Limited by playbook coverage Unlimited Consistency Varies by analyst Rigid Deterministic Integration with MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK A3R correlates detected patterns to the MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK framework, providing tactical context for every artifact. This mapping helps analysts understand where an attack sits in the kill chain and anticipate what might come next.\nCommon mappings include:\nExecution — PowerShell, command shell, scripting interpreters Command \u0026amp; Control — Ingress tool transfer, web protocols Credential Access — Credential dumping, LSASS access Defense Evasion — Disabling security tools, indicator removal Impact — Data encryption, ransomware activity Key Features of A3R ✅ Forensic-Grade Artifact Extraction Parses complex alert formats from EDR, SIEM, and email gateway exports.\n✅ Deterministic Threat Verification Transparent, auditable logic. No black boxes.\n✅ Autonomous Report Generation Produces customer-ready incident reports in seconds.\n✅ False Positive Suppression Recognizes security vendors, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise tools.\n✅ Threat Intelligence Integration Enriches artifacts with external TI to validate indicators.\n✅ MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK Alignment Every detection maps to the industry-standard framework.\nStop Drowning in Alerts A3R is the core capability powering AegisPrime—an autonomous alert triage platform designed for MSP security teams and enterprise SOCs.\nReady to see A3R in action?\n👉 Join the Beta Waitlist\nFrequently Asked Questions What does A3R stand for? A3R = Automated Artifact Analysis \u0026amp; Response\nHow is A3R different from EDR? EDR detects threats and collects telemetry. A3R analyzes that telemetry, verifies the threat, and generates the incident report. They work together—A3R consumes EDR output.\nHow is A3R different from SOAR? SOAR orchestrates response actions via playbooks. A3R produces the analysis and recommendations that SOAR then executes. A3R fills the gap between detection and orchestration.\nDoes A3R replace analysts? No. A3R accelerates analysts by handling the time-consuming artifact analysis and report writing. Analysts focus on validation, decision-making, and customer communication.\nDoes A3R use AI/ML? A3R uses deterministic heuristics and pattern matching. This ensures consistent, auditable, and explainable results.\nWhat alert sources does A3R support?

It\u0026rsquo;s a strategic choice.\nThe Validation Test If\u0026hellip; Then\u0026hellip; A3R provides value without AI We have a core product A3R needs AI to work We have a wrapper By launching \u0026ldquo;naked\u0026rdquo; first, we force ourselves to prove the value of Automated Artifact Analysis (A3R) using pure logic:\nRegex patterns that catch obfuscated PowerShell Heuristic scoring that weights threat indicators Deterministic rules that produce the same output for the same input Same input → Same output. Every time. Auditable. Defensible in court.\nWhy This Matters for Your SOC 1. No Hallucination Risk LLMs can fabricate MITRE techniques, invent IOCs, or confidently misclassify benign activity as malicious. Our deterministic engine doesn\u0026rsquo;t guess — it matches patterns and applies weighted logic.\n2. Reproducible Verdicts When your analyst runs the same alert through AegisPrime twice, they get the exact same verdict. No variability, no \u0026ldquo;well, it depends on how the model feels today.\u0026rdquo;\n3. Faster Response No API calls to OpenAI. No waiting for GPU inference. Pure Python logic executes in milliseconds.\nBeta 2: AI as Force Multiplier When we add LLM capabilities in Beta 2, the AI won\u0026rsquo;t be the brain — it will be the explainer.\nThe verdict will already exist. The AI\u0026rsquo;s job is to articulate why the deterministic logic flagged the artifact, making the reasoning accessible to junior analysts.\nPhase Role Beta 1 (Now) Engine proves value without AI Beta 2 (Future) AI explains the engine\u0026rsquo;s decisions The AI becomes a force multiplier, not the foundation.\nThe Sovereign AI Difference When Phase 2 ships, we still won\u0026rsquo;t rent intelligence from OpenAI, Anthropic, or any third-party provider.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t rent intelligence from OpenAI. We own the brain. Your data is processed on our private, isolated infrastructure and never leaves our control loop.\u0026rdquo;\nOur architecture:\nRailway = Control plane (our infrastructure) AWS Private VPC = GPU inference (our infrastructure) Open-source models = No third-party API keys Your data flows through systems we control end-to-end. When the GPU finishes processing, that memory is wiped. No logs. No training. No egress.\nWhat This Means for You If you\u0026rsquo;re evaluating security tools that claim to be \u0026ldquo;AI-powered,\u0026rdquo; ask them:\nWhat happens when the AI is unavailable? Can I reproduce a verdict from last week? Who owns the AI infrastructure? If the answers are \u0026ldquo;it breaks,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;maybe,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;OpenAI\u0026rdquo; — you might want to look elsewhere.\nAegisPrime is designed to earn your trust the hard way: by proving value with pure logic first, then enhancing it with AI we own and control.\nReady to try the naked engine?

A3R (Automated Artifact Analysis \u0026amp; Response) is a new security discipline that sits between EDR and SOAR. While EDR detects threats and SOAR manages tickets, A3R autonomously deconstructs forensic evidence, verifies the threat with deterministic logic, and generates the final incident report.\nA3R addresses the critical gap in modern security operations: the analyst bottleneck between detection and response.\nWhere A3R Fits in the Security Stack The Gap A3R Closes Layer What It Does What It Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Do EDR/XDR Detects suspicious activity, collects telemetry Doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain why it\u0026rsquo;s bad or what to do A3R Deconstructs artifacts, verifies threats, generates reports Doesn\u0026rsquo;t detect or execute response actions SOAR Orchestrates playbooks, automates response actions Doesn\u0026rsquo;t analyze evidence or make risk decisions How A3R Works A3R processes security alerts through a deterministic analysis pipeline that extracts, evaluates, and verifies every artifact in the alert data.\nThe A3R Pipeline Artifact Extraction — Parse URLs, IPs, domains, processes, files, and command-line arguments from alert data Heuristic Analysis — Apply behavioral detection rules to identify suspicious patterns MITRE Correlation — Map detected behaviors to ATT\u0026amp;CK techniques and tactics Risk Scoring — Calculate weighted risk scores based on artifact behavior Threat Intelligence Enrichment — Query external TI sources to validate indicators Report Generation — Produce structured incident reports with Root Cause Analysis Deterministic, Not Probabilistic Unlike machine learning-based tools that produce confidence intervals and \u0026ldquo;best guesses,\u0026rdquo; A3R is fully deterministic:\nSame input → Same output. Every time. No hallucinations.\nThis means:\nAuditable decisions — Every verdict traces back to specific rules and patterns No model drift — Behavior doesn\u0026rsquo;t change unexpectedly over time Explainable results — Analysts understand exactly why an alert was flagged The Three Pillars of A3R 1. Automated Artifact Deconstruction A3R extracts and categorizes every forensic artifact from alert data:\nArtifact Type What A3R Extracts Processes Execution paths, command-line args, parent/child relationships Network URLs, domains, IP addresses, ports, connection patterns Files File paths, hashes, extensions, write locations Behaviors LOLBin usage, encoded commands, persistence mechanisms 2. Deterministic Threat Verification Each artifact is evaluated against layered detection logic:\nDetection Layer Example Patterns Known Malicious Known malware families, attack frameworks LOLBin Abuse Living-off-the-land binary misuse Behavioral Flags Suspicious execution patterns, lateral movement Network Indicators Untrusted infrastructure, domain spoofing 3. Autonomous Report Generation A3R produces complete incident reports ready for customer delivery:\nHeadline — What type of attack was detected Narrative — Plain-English explanation of the attack sequence Entry Point — How the attack began Artifacts — Every indicator with verdict and reasoning MITRE Mapping — Attack chain aligned to ATT\u0026amp;CK framework Mitigation Steps — Specific, actionable remediation recommendations The \u0026ldquo;Zero-Context\u0026rdquo; Advantage Most EDRs are behavioral—they need to observe a process doing something malicious to catch it. If they miss the execution, they miss the threat.\nA3R is intrinsic—it analyzes the artifact itself.\nApproach What It Does The Limitation EDR (Behavioral) \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t see who ran this command, so I can\u0026rsquo;t say if it\u0026rsquo;s bad.\u0026rdquo; Requires execution context A3R (Intrinsic) \u0026ldquo;This syntax is a known attack pattern. It is malicious by definition, regardless of who ran it.\u0026rdquo; None—artifact speaks for itself This allows A3R to catch Living-off-the-Land (LOLBin) attacks that often slip past behavioral monitors. When an attacker uses legitimate system tools in malicious ways, A3R recognizes the pattern—not the permission.\nWhy A3R Matters The Analyst Bottleneck Security teams drown in alerts. The typical workflow:\nEDR fires alert → goes to queue Analyst manually investigates (10-30 minutes) Analyst writes incident report (15-45 minutes) Ticket created in SOAR → response executed The problem: Steps 2 and 3 require skilled analysts and significant time. This creates a bottleneck that limits how many alerts can be properly investigated.\nA3R Eliminates the Bottleneck With A3R:\nEDR fires alert → A3R processes automatically A3R deconstructs artifacts + generates report (~seconds) Analyst reviews and validates (2-5 minutes) Ticket created in SOAR → response executed Result: Dramatic reduction in time-to-report. Analysts focus on validation and response, not manual investigation.\nA3R vs. Traditional Approaches Capability Manual Analysis SOAR Playbooks A3R Artifact extraction Human reading logs Static parsers Dynamic, context-aware extraction Threat verification Analyst judgment Rule-based (yes/no) Weighted scoring + reasoning Report generation Human writing Templates Autonomous narrative generation Scalability Limited by headcount Limited by playbook coverage Unlimited Consistency Varies by analyst Rigid Deterministic Integration with MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK A3R correlates detected patterns to the MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK framework, providing tactical context for every artifact. This mapping helps analysts understand where an attack sits in the kill chain and anticipate what might come next.\nCommon mappings include:\nExecution — PowerShell, command shell, scripting interpreters Command \u0026amp; Control — Ingress tool transfer, web protocols Credential Access — Credential dumping, LSASS access Defense Evasion — Disabling security tools, indicator removal Impact — Data encryption, ransomware activity Key Features of A3R ✅ Forensic-Grade Artifact Extraction Parses complex alert formats from EDR, SIEM, and email gateway exports.\n✅ Deterministic Threat Verification Transparent, auditable logic. No black boxes.\n✅ Autonomous Report Generation Produces customer-ready incident reports in seconds.\n✅ False Positive Suppression Recognizes security vendors, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise tools.\n✅ Threat Intelligence Integration Enriches artifacts with external TI to validate indicators.\n✅ MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK Alignment Every detection maps to the industry-standard framework.\nStop Drowning in Alerts A3R is the core capability powering AegisPrime—an autonomous alert triage platform designed for MSP security teams and enterprise SOCs.\nReady to see A3R in action?\n👉 Join the Beta Waitlist\nFrequently Asked Questions What does A3R stand for? A3R = Automated Artifact Analysis \u0026amp; Response\nHow is A3R different from EDR? EDR detects threats and collects telemetry. A3R analyzes that telemetry, verifies the threat, and generates the incident report. They work together—A3R consumes EDR output.\nHow is A3R different from SOAR? SOAR orchestrates response actions via playbooks. A3R produces the analysis and recommendations that SOAR then executes. A3R fills the gap between detection and orchestration.\nDoes A3R replace analysts? No. A3R accelerates analysts by handling the time-consuming artifact analysis and report writing. Analysts focus on validation, decision-making, and customer communication.\nDoes A3R use AI/ML? A3R uses deterministic heuristics and pattern matching. This ensures consistent, auditable, and explainable results.\nWhat alert sources does A3R support? A3R accepts exports from major EDR/XDR platforms, SIEMs, and email security gateways.\nHave questions about A3R?

While EDR detects threats and SOAR manages tickets, A3R autonomously deconstructs forensic evidence, verifies the threat with deterministic logic, and generates the final incident report.\nA3R addresses the critical gap in modern security operations: the analyst bottleneck between detection and response.\nWhere A3R Fits in the Security Stack ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ DETECTION LAYER │ │ EDR / XDR / SIEM / Email Gateway │ │ \u0026#34;Something happened\u0026#34; │ └─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘ │ ▼ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ A3R LAYER │ │ Automated Artifact Analysis \u0026amp; Response │ │ \u0026#34;Here\u0026#39;s exactly what happened and what to do\u0026#34; │ └─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘ │ ▼ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ ORCHESTRATION LAYER │ │ SOAR / Ticketing │ │ \u0026#34;Execute the response\u0026#34; │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ The Gap A3R Closes Layer What It Does What It Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Do EDR/XDR Detects suspicious activity, collects telemetry Doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain why it\u0026rsquo;s bad or what to do A3R Deconstructs artifacts, verifies threats, generates reports Doesn\u0026rsquo;t detect or execute response actions SOAR Orchestrates playbooks, automates response actions Doesn\u0026rsquo;t analyze evidence or make risk decisions How A3R Works A3R processes security alerts through a deterministic analysis pipeline that extracts, evaluates, and verifies every artifact in the alert data.\nThe A3R Pipeline Artifact Extraction — Parse URLs, IPs, domains, processes, files, and command-line arguments from alert data Heuristic Analysis — Apply behavioral detection rules to identify suspicious patterns MITRE Correlation — Map detected behaviors to ATT\u0026amp;CK techniques and tactics Risk Scoring — Calculate weighted risk scores based on artifact behavior Threat Intelligence Enrichment — Query external TI sources to validate indicators Report Generation — Produce structured incident reports with Root Cause Analysis Deterministic, Not Probabilistic Unlike machine learning-based tools that produce confidence intervals and \u0026ldquo;best guesses,\u0026rdquo; A3R is fully deterministic:\nSame input → Same output. Every time. No hallucinations.\nThis means:\nAuditable decisions — Every verdict traces back to specific rules and patterns No model drift — Behavior doesn\u0026rsquo;t change unexpectedly over time Explainable results — Analysts understand exactly why an alert was flagged The Three Pillars of A3R 1. Automated Artifact Deconstruction A3R extracts and categorizes every forensic artifact from alert data:\nArtifact Type What A3R Extracts Processes Execution paths, command-line args, parent/child relationships Network URLs, domains, IP addresses, ports, connection patterns Files File paths, hashes, extensions, write locations Behaviors LOLBin usage, encoded commands, persistence mechanisms 2. Deterministic Threat Verification Each artifact is evaluated against layered detection logic:\nDetection Layer Example Patterns Known Malicious Known malware families, attack frameworks LOLBin Abuse Living-off-the-land binary misuse Behavioral Flags Suspicious execution patterns, lateral movement Network Indicators Untrusted infrastructure, domain spoofing 3. Autonomous Report Generation A3R produces complete incident reports ready for customer delivery:\nHeadline — What type of attack was detected Narrative — Plain-English explanation of the attack sequence Entry Point — How the attack began Artifacts — Every indicator with verdict and reasoning MITRE Mapping — Attack chain aligned to ATT\u0026amp;CK framework Mitigation Steps — Specific, actionable remediation recommendations The \u0026ldquo;Zero-Context\u0026rdquo; Advantage Most EDRs are behavioral—they need to observe a process doing something malicious to catch it. If they miss the execution, they miss the threat.\nA3R is intrinsic—it analyzes the artifact itself.\nApproach What It Does The Limitation EDR (Behavioral) \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t see who ran this command, so I can\u0026rsquo;t say if it\u0026rsquo;s bad.\u0026rdquo; Requires execution context A3R (Intrinsic) \u0026ldquo;This syntax is a known attack pattern. It is malicious by definition, regardless of who ran it.\u0026rdquo; None—artifact speaks for itself This allows A3R to catch Living-off-the-Land (LOLBin) attacks that often slip past behavioral monitors. When an attacker uses legitimate system tools in malicious ways, A3R recognizes the pattern—not the permission.\nWhy A3R Matters The Analyst Bottleneck Security teams drown in alerts. The typical workflow:\nEDR fires alert → goes to queue Analyst manually investigates (10-30 minutes) Analyst writes incident report (15-45 minutes) Ticket created in SOAR → response executed The problem: Steps 2 and 3 require skilled analysts and significant time. This creates a bottleneck that limits how many alerts can be properly investigated.\nA3R Eliminates the Bottleneck With A3R:\nEDR fires alert → A3R processes automatically A3R deconstructs artifacts + generates report (~seconds) Analyst reviews and validates (2-5 minutes) Ticket created in SOAR → response executed Result: Dramatic reduction in time-to-report. Analysts focus on validation and response, not manual investigation.\nA3R vs. Traditional Approaches Capability Manual Analysis SOAR Playbooks A3R Artifact extraction Human reading logs Static parsers Dynamic, context-aware extraction Threat verification Analyst judgment Rule-based (yes/no) Weighted scoring + reasoning Report generation Human writing Templates Autonomous narrative generation Scalability Limited by headcount Limited by playbook coverage Unlimited Consistency Varies by analyst Rigid Deterministic Integration with MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK A3R correlates detected patterns to the MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK framework, providing tactical context for every artifact. This mapping helps analysts understand where an attack sits in the kill chain and anticipate what might come next.\nCommon mappings include:\nExecution — PowerShell, command shell, scripting interpreters Command \u0026amp; Control — Ingress tool transfer, web protocols Credential Access — Credential dumping, LSASS access Defense Evasion — Disabling security tools, indicator removal Impact — Data encryption, ransomware activity Key Features of A3R ✅ Forensic-Grade Artifact Extraction Parses complex alert formats from EDR, SIEM, and email gateway exports.\n✅ Deterministic Threat Verification Transparent, auditable logic. No black boxes.\n✅ Autonomous Report Generation Produces customer-ready incident reports in seconds.\n✅ False Positive Suppression Recognizes security vendors, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise tools.\n✅ Threat Intelligence Integration Enriches artifacts with external TI to validate indicators.\n✅ MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK Alignment Every detection maps to the industry-standard framework.\nStop Drowning in Alerts A3R is the core capability powering AegisPrime—an autonomous alert triage platform designed for MSP security teams and enterprise SOCs.\nReady to see A3R in action?\n👉 Join the Beta Waitlist\nFrequently Asked Questions What does A3R stand for? A3R = Automated Artifact Analysis \u0026amp; Response\nHow is A3R different from EDR? EDR detects threats and collects telemetry. A3R analyzes that telemetry, verifies the threat, and generates the incident report. They work together—A3R consumes EDR output.\nHow is A3R different from SOAR? SOAR orchestrates response actions via playbooks. A3R produces the analysis and recommendations that SOAR then executes. A3R fills the gap between detection and orchestration.\nDoes A3R replace analysts? No. A3R accelerates analysts by handling the time-consuming artifact analysis and report writing. Analysts focus on validation, decision-making, and customer communication.\nDoes A3R use AI/ML? A3R uses deterministic heuristics and pattern matching. This ensures consistent, auditable, and explainable results.\nWhat alert sources does A3R support? A3R accepts exports from major EDR/XDR platforms, SIEMs, and email security gateways.\nHave questions about A3R?

You have a prompt.\nAegisPrime Beta 1: The Naked Engine We\u0026rsquo;re launching our beta with a 100% deterministic pipeline — no LLM dependency. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a limitation. It\u0026rsquo;s a strategic choice.\nThe Validation Test If\u0026hellip; Then\u0026hellip; A3R provides value without AI We have a core product A3R needs AI to work We have a wrapper By launching \u0026ldquo;naked\u0026rdquo; first, we force ourselves to prove the value of Automated Artifact Analysis (A3R) using pure logic:\nRegex patterns that catch obfuscated PowerShell Heuristic scoring that weights threat indicators Deterministic rules that produce the same output for the same input Same input → Same output. Every time. Auditable. Defensible in court.\nWhy This Matters for Your SOC 1. No Hallucination Risk LLMs can fabricate MITRE techniques, invent IOCs, or confidently misclassify benign activity as malicious. Our deterministic engine doesn\u0026rsquo;t guess — it matches patterns and applies weighted logic.\n2. Reproducible Verdicts When your analyst runs the same alert through AegisPrime twice, they get the exact same verdict. No variability, no \u0026ldquo;well, it depends on how the model feels today.\u0026rdquo;\n3. Faster Response No API calls to OpenAI. No waiting for GPU inference. Pure Python logic executes in milliseconds.\nBeta 2: AI as Force Multiplier When we add LLM capabilities in Beta 2, the AI won\u0026rsquo;t be the brain — it will be the explainer.\nThe verdict will already exist. The AI\u0026rsquo;s job is to articulate why the deterministic logic flagged the artifact, making the reasoning accessible to junior analysts.\nPhase Role Beta 1 (Now) Engine proves value without AI Beta 2 (Future) AI explains the engine\u0026rsquo;s decisions The AI becomes a force multiplier, not the foundation.\nThe Sovereign AI Difference When Phase 2 ships, we still won\u0026rsquo;t rent intelligence from OpenAI, Anthropic, or any third-party provider.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t rent intelligence from OpenAI. We own the brain. Your data is processed on our private, isolated infrastructure and never leaves our control loop.\u0026rdquo;\nOur architecture:\nRailway = Control plane (our infrastructure) AWS Private VPC = GPU inference (our infrastructure) Open-source models = No third-party API keys Your data flows through systems we control end-to-end. When the GPU finishes processing, that memory is wiped. No logs. No training. No egress.\nWhat This Means for You If you\u0026rsquo;re evaluating security tools that claim to be \u0026ldquo;AI-powered,\u0026rdquo; ask them:\nWhat happens when the AI is unavailable? Can I reproduce a verdict from last week? Who owns the AI infrastructure? If the answers are \u0026ldquo;it breaks,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;maybe,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;OpenAI\u0026rdquo; — you might want to look elsewhere.\nAegisPrime is designed to earn your trust the hard way: by proving value with pure logic first, then enhancing it with AI we own and control.\nReady to try the naked engine?

A3R (Automated Artifact Analysis \u0026amp; Response) is a new security discipline that sits between EDR and SOAR. While EDR detects threats and SOAR manages tickets, A3R autonomously deconstructs forensic evidence, verifies the threat with deterministic logic, and generates the final incident report.\nA3R addresses the critical gap in modern security operations: the analyst bottleneck between detection and response.\nWhere A3R Fits in the Security Stack ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ DETECTION LAYER │ │ EDR / XDR / SIEM / Email Gateway │ │ \u0026#34;Something happened\u0026#34; │ └─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘ │ ▼ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ A3R LAYER │ │ Automated Artifact Analysis \u0026amp; Response │ │ \u0026#34;Here\u0026#39;s exactly what happened and what to do\u0026#34; │ └─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘ │ ▼ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ ORCHESTRATION LAYER │ │ SOAR / Ticketing │ │ \u0026#34;Execute the response\u0026#34; │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ The Gap A3R Closes Layer What It Does What It Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Do EDR/XDR Detects suspicious activity, collects telemetry Doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain why it\u0026rsquo;s bad or what to do A3R Deconstructs artifacts, verifies threats, generates reports Doesn\u0026rsquo;t detect or execute response actions SOAR Orchestrates playbooks, automates response actions Doesn\u0026rsquo;t analyze evidence or make risk decisions How A3R Works A3R processes security alerts through a deterministic analysis pipeline that extracts, evaluates, and verifies every artifact in the alert data.\nThe A3R Pipeline Artifact Extraction — Parse URLs, IPs, domains, processes, files, and command-line arguments from alert data Heuristic Analysis — Apply behavioral detection rules to identify suspicious patterns MITRE Correlation — Map detected behaviors to ATT\u0026amp;CK techniques and tactics Risk Scoring — Calculate weighted risk scores based on artifact behavior Threat Intelligence Enrichment — Query external TI sources to validate indicators Report Generation — Produce structured incident reports with Root Cause Analysis Deterministic, Not Probabilistic Unlike machine learning-based tools that produce confidence intervals and \u0026ldquo;best guesses,\u0026rdquo; A3R is fully deterministic:\nSame input → Same output. Every time. No hallucinations.\nThis means:\nAuditable decisions — Every verdict traces back to specific rules and patterns No model drift — Behavior doesn\u0026rsquo;t change unexpectedly over time Explainable results — Analysts understand exactly why an alert was flagged The Three Pillars of A3R 1. Automated Artifact Deconstruction A3R extracts and categorizes every forensic artifact from alert data:\nArtifact Type What A3R Extracts Processes Execution paths, command-line args, parent/child relationships Network URLs, domains, IP addresses, ports, connection patterns Files File paths, hashes, extensions, write locations Behaviors LOLBin usage, encoded commands, persistence mechanisms 2. Deterministic Threat Verification Each artifact is evaluated against layered detection logic:\nDetection Layer Example Patterns Known Malicious Known malware families, attack frameworks LOLBin Abuse Living-off-the-land binary misuse Behavioral Flags Suspicious execution patterns, lateral movement Network Indicators Untrusted infrastructure, domain spoofing 3. Autonomous Report Generation A3R produces complete incident reports ready for customer delivery:\nHeadline — What type of attack was detected Narrative — Plain-English explanation of the attack sequence Entry Point — How the attack began Artifacts — Every indicator with verdict and reasoning MITRE Mapping — Attack chain aligned to ATT\u0026amp;CK framework Mitigation Steps — Specific, actionable remediation recommendations The \u0026ldquo;Zero-Context\u0026rdquo; Advantage Most EDRs are behavioral—they need to observe a process doing something malicious to catch it. If they miss the execution, they miss the threat.\nA3R is intrinsic—it analyzes the artifact itself.\nApproach What It Does The Limitation EDR (Behavioral) \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t see who ran this command, so I can\u0026rsquo;t say if it\u0026rsquo;s bad.\u0026rdquo; Requires execution context A3R (Intrinsic) \u0026ldquo;This syntax is a known attack pattern. It is malicious by definition, regardless of who ran it.\u0026rdquo; None—artifact speaks for itself This allows A3R to catch Living-off-the-Land (LOLBin) attacks that often slip past behavioral monitors. When an attacker uses legitimate system tools in malicious ways, A3R recognizes the pattern—not the permission.\nWhy A3R Matters The Analyst Bottleneck Security teams drown in alerts. The typical workflow:\nEDR fires alert → goes to queue Analyst manually investigates (10-30 minutes) Analyst writes incident report (15-45 minutes) Ticket created in SOAR → response executed The problem: Steps 2 and 3 require skilled analysts and significant time. This creates a bottleneck that limits how many alerts can be properly investigated.\nA3R Eliminates the Bottleneck With A3R:\nEDR fires alert → A3R processes automatically A3R deconstructs artifacts + generates report (~seconds) Analyst reviews and validates (2-5 minutes) Ticket created in SOAR → response executed Result: Dramatic reduction in time-to-report. Analysts focus on validation and response, not manual investigation.\nA3R vs. Traditional Approaches Capability Manual Analysis SOAR Playbooks A3R Artifact extraction Human reading logs Static parsers Dynamic, context-aware extraction Threat verification Analyst judgment Rule-based (yes/no) Weighted scoring + reasoning Report generation Human writing Templates Autonomous narrative generation Scalability Limited by headcount Limited by playbook coverage Unlimited Consistency Varies by analyst Rigid Deterministic Integration with MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK A3R correlates detected patterns to the MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK framework, providing tactical context for every artifact. This mapping helps analysts understand where an attack sits in the kill chain and anticipate what might come next.\nCommon mappings include:\nExecution — PowerShell, command shell, scripting interpreters Command \u0026amp; Control — Ingress tool transfer, web protocols Credential Access — Credential dumping, LSASS access Defense Evasion — Disabling security tools, indicator removal Impact — Data encryption, ransomware activity Key Features of A3R ✅ Forensic-Grade Artifact Extraction Parses complex alert formats from EDR, SIEM, and email gateway exports.\n✅ Deterministic Threat Verification Transparent, auditable logic. No black boxes.\n✅ Autonomous Report Generation Produces customer-ready incident reports in seconds.\n✅ False Positive Suppression Recognizes security vendors, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise tools.\n✅ Threat Intelligence Integration Enriches artifacts with external TI to validate indicators.\n✅ MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK Alignment Every detection maps to the industry-standard framework.\nStop Drowning in Alerts A3R is the core capability powering AegisPrime—an autonomous alert triage platform designed for MSP security teams and enterprise SOCs.\nReady to see A3R in action?\n👉 Join the Beta Waitlist\nFrequently Asked Questions What does A3R stand for? A3R = Automated Artifact Analysis \u0026amp; Response\nHow is A3R different from EDR? EDR detects threats and collects telemetry. A3R analyzes that telemetry, verifies the threat, and generates the incident report. They work together—A3R consumes EDR output.\nHow is A3R different from SOAR? SOAR orchestrates response actions via playbooks. A3R produces the analysis and recommendations that SOAR then executes. A3R fills the gap between detection and orchestration.\nDoes A3R replace analysts? No. A3R accelerates analysts by handling the time-consuming artifact analysis and report writing. Analysts focus on validation, decision-making, and customer communication.\nDoes A3R use AI/ML? A3R uses deterministic heuristics and pattern matching. This ensures consistent, auditable, and explainable results.\nWhat alert sources does A3R support? A3R accepts exports from major EDR/XDR platforms, SIEMs, and email security gateways.\nHave questions about A3R?

It\u0026rsquo;s a strategic choice.\nThe Validation Test If\u0026hellip; Then\u0026hellip; A3R provides value without AI We have a core product A3R needs AI to work We have a wrapper By launching \u0026ldquo;naked\u0026rdquo; first, we force ourselves to prove the value of Automated Artifact Analysis (A3R) using pure logic:\nRegex patterns that catch obfuscated PowerShell Heuristic scoring that weights threat indicators Deterministic rules that produce the same output for the same input Same input → Same output. Every time. Auditable. Defensible in court.\nWhy This Matters for Your SOC 1. No Hallucination Risk LLMs can fabricate MITRE techniques, invent IOCs, or confidently misclassify benign activity as malicious. Our deterministic engine doesn\u0026rsquo;t guess — it matches patterns and applies weighted logic.\n2. Reproducible Verdicts When your analyst runs the same alert through AegisPrime twice, they get the exact same verdict.

Pure Python logic executes in milliseconds.\nBeta 2: AI as Force Multiplier When we add LLM capabilities in Beta 2, the AI won\u0026rsquo;t be the brain — it will be the explainer.\nThe verdict will already exist. The AI\u0026rsquo;s job is to articulate why the deterministic logic flagged the artifact, making the reasoning accessible to junior analysts.\nPhase Role Beta 1 (Now) Engine proves value without AI Beta 2 (Future) AI explains the engine\u0026rsquo;s decisions The AI becomes a force multiplier, not the foundation.\nThe Sovereign AI Difference When Phase 2 ships, we still won\u0026rsquo;t rent intelligence from OpenAI, Anthropic, or any third-party provider.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t rent intelligence from OpenAI. We own the brain.

When the GPU finishes processing, that memory is wiped. No logs. No training. No egress.\nWhat This Means for You If you\u0026rsquo;re evaluating security tools that claim to be \u0026ldquo;AI-powered,\u0026rdquo; ask them:\nWhat happens when the AI is unavailable? Can I reproduce a verdict from last week? Who owns the AI infrastructure?

A3R (Automated Artifact Analysis \u0026amp; Response) is a new security discipline that sits between EDR and SOAR. While EDR detects threats and SOAR manages tickets, A3R autonomously deconstructs forensic evidence, verifies the threat with deterministic logic, and generates the final incident report.\nA3R addresses the critical gap in modern security operations: the analyst bottleneck between detection and response.\nWhere A3R Fits in the Security Stack ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ DETECTION LAYER │ │ EDR / XDR / SIEM / Email Gateway │ │ \u0026#34;Something happened\u0026#34; │ └─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘ │ ▼ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ A3R LAYER │ │ Automated Artifact Analysis \u0026amp; Response │ │ \u0026#34;Here\u0026#39;s exactly what happened and what to do\u0026#34; │ └─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘ │ ▼ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ ORCHESTRATION LAYER │ │ SOAR / Ticketing │ │ \u0026#34;Execute the response\u0026#34; │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ The Gap A3R Closes Layer What It Does What It Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Do EDR/XDR Detects suspicious activity, collects telemetry Doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain why it\u0026rsquo;s bad or what to do A3R Deconstructs artifacts, verifies threats, generates reports Doesn\u0026rsquo;t detect or execute response actions SOAR Orchestrates playbooks, automates response actions Doesn\u0026rsquo;t analyze evidence or make risk decisions How A3R Works A3R processes security alerts through a deterministic analysis pipeline that extracts, evaluates, and verifies every artifact in the alert data.\nThe A3R Pipeline Artifact Extraction — Parse URLs, IPs, domains, processes, files, and command-line arguments from alert data Heuristic Analysis — Apply behavioral detection rules to identify suspicious patterns MITRE Correlation — Map detected behaviors to ATT\u0026amp;CK techniques and tactics Risk Scoring — Calculate weighted risk scores based on artifact behavior Threat Intelligence Enrichment — Query external TI sources to validate indicators Report Generation — Produce structured incident reports with Root Cause Analysis Deterministic, Not Probabilistic Unlike machine learning-based tools that produce confidence intervals and \u0026ldquo;best guesses,\u0026rdquo; A3R is fully deterministic:\nSame input → Same output. Every time. No hallucinations.\nThis means:\nAuditable decisions — Every verdict traces back to specific rules and patterns No model drift — Behavior doesn\u0026rsquo;t change unexpectedly over time Explainable results — Analysts understand exactly why an alert was flagged The Three Pillars of A3R 1. Automated Artifact Deconstruction A3R extracts and categorizes every forensic artifact from alert data:\nArtifact Type What A3R Extracts Processes Execution paths, command-line args, parent/child relationships Network URLs, domains, IP addresses, ports, connection patterns Files File paths, hashes, extensions, write locations Behaviors LOLBin usage, encoded commands, persistence mechanisms 2. Deterministic Threat Verification Each artifact is evaluated against layered detection logic:\nDetection Layer Example Patterns Known Malicious Known malware families, attack frameworks LOLBin Abuse Living-off-the-land binary misuse Behavioral Flags Suspicious execution patterns, lateral movement Network Indicators Untrusted infrastructure, domain spoofing 3. Autonomous Report Generation A3R produces complete incident reports ready for customer delivery:\nHeadline — What type of attack was detected Narrative — Plain-English explanation of the attack sequence Entry Point — How the attack began Artifacts — Every indicator with verdict and reasoning MITRE Mapping — Attack chain aligned to ATT\u0026amp;CK framework Mitigation Steps — Specific, actionable remediation recommendations The \u0026ldquo;Zero-Context\u0026rdquo; Advantage Most EDRs are behavioral—they need to observe a process doing something malicious to catch it. If they miss the execution, they miss the threat.\nA3R is intrinsic—it analyzes the artifact itself.\nApproach What It Does The Limitation EDR (Behavioral) \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t see who ran this command, so I can\u0026rsquo;t say if it\u0026rsquo;s bad.\u0026rdquo; Requires execution context A3R (Intrinsic) \u0026ldquo;This syntax is a known attack pattern. It is malicious by definition, regardless of who ran it.\u0026rdquo; None—artifact speaks for itself This allows A3R to catch Living-off-the-Land (LOLBin) attacks that often slip past behavioral monitors. When an attacker uses legitimate system tools in malicious ways, A3R recognizes the pattern—not the permission.\nWhy A3R Matters The Analyst Bottleneck Security teams drown in alerts. The typical workflow:\nEDR fires alert → goes to queue Analyst manually investigates (10-30 minutes) Analyst writes incident report (15-45 minutes) Ticket created in SOAR → response executed The problem: Steps 2 and 3 require skilled analysts and significant time. This creates a bottleneck that limits how many alerts can be properly investigated.\nA3R Eliminates the Bottleneck With A3R:\nEDR fires alert → A3R processes automatically A3R deconstructs artifacts + generates report (~seconds) Analyst reviews and validates (2-5 minutes) Ticket created in SOAR → response executed Result: Dramatic reduction in time-to-report. Analysts focus on validation and response, not manual investigation.\nA3R vs. Traditional Approaches Capability Manual Analysis SOAR Playbooks A3R Artifact extraction Human reading logs Static parsers Dynamic, context-aware extraction Threat verification Analyst judgment Rule-based (yes/no) Weighted scoring + reasoning Report generation Human writing Templates Autonomous narrative generation Scalability Limited by headcount Limited by playbook coverage Unlimited Consistency Varies by analyst Rigid Deterministic Integration with MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK A3R correlates detected patterns to the MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK framework, providing tactical context for every artifact. This mapping helps analysts understand where an attack sits in the kill chain and anticipate what might come next.\nCommon mappings include:\nExecution — PowerShell, command shell, scripting interpreters Command \u0026amp; Control — Ingress tool transfer, web protocols Credential Access — Credential dumping, LSASS access Defense Evasion — Disabling security tools, indicator removal Impact — Data encryption, ransomware activity Key Features of A3R ✅ Forensic-Grade Artifact Extraction Parses complex alert formats from EDR, SIEM, and email gateway exports.\n✅ Deterministic Threat Verification Transparent, auditable logic. No black boxes.\n✅ Autonomous Report Generation Produces customer-ready incident reports in seconds.\n✅ False Positive Suppression Recognizes security vendors, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise tools.\n✅ Threat Intelligence Integration Enriches artifacts with external TI to validate indicators.\n✅ MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK Alignment Every detection maps to the industry-standard framework.\nStop Drowning in Alerts A3R is the core capability powering AegisPrime—an autonomous alert triage platform designed for MSP security teams and enterprise SOCs.\nReady to see A3R in action?\n👉 Join the Beta Waitlist\nFrequently Asked Questions What does A3R stand for? A3R = Automated Artifact Analysis \u0026amp; Response\nHow is A3R different from EDR? EDR detects threats and collects telemetry. A3R analyzes that telemetry, verifies the threat, and generates the incident report. They work together—A3R consumes EDR output.\nHow is A3R different from SOAR? SOAR orchestrates response actions via playbooks. A3R produces the analysis and recommendations that SOAR then executes. A3R fills the gap between detection and orchestration.\nDoes A3R replace analysts? No. A3R accelerates analysts by handling the time-consuming artifact analysis and report writing. Analysts focus on validation, decision-making, and customer communication.\nDoes A3R use AI/ML? A3R uses deterministic heuristics and pattern matching. This ensures consistent, auditable, and explainable results.\nWhat alert sources does A3R support? A3R accepts exports from major EDR/XDR platforms, SIEMs, and email security gateways.\nHave questions about A3R?
